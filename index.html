            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is also known as Source Control Management or Revision Control. When working on a long term and constantly evolving project, is not very effective to save multiple progressions of the project as different file names and with different dates to distinguish each file from another. Although sometimes this works, if you are working on a project with many people, it can get confusing as to which file is the most up to date- especially if people use different naming conventions. This is why Version Control was created. A Version Control System keeps track of who is editing what file, when they edited that file, what they did to change the file, and then finally merges that file back with the original.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository allows one to make changes to a document or a file locally, and save them using version control, but not send them off to a remote server until they are ready. This is useful when people are working on the same project separately, and want to keep track of their own singular progress before reconvening and merging works between the other members of the team. It is also convenient to have a local repository because there is no complicated server software that is needed to use it, that comes in with a remote repository which is similar, but not stored on the computer itself.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Committing local changes to a remote repository is essentially like backing up your work. This is the best method to use when saving different versions of a code because it is cleaner and much more organized than saving multiple versions of a file as different names. Remote repository means that it is not housed on a local system, such as your own computer, but it is housed somewhere offsite that is able to merge different files together as one. For example, if multiple people are working on the same project, they are able to use their local repository for the files that they are working on, and then when they are done with their version, they send it off to a remote repository to be with everyone else’s work where it is then combined together.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is a Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git keeps track of files. It perceives these files as “snapshots” and is able to organize them as such. Every time a developer saves the file he or she is working on, the Git takes note of what that file looks like and commits it where it is. If a file is not changed when it is committed, then the Git does not store that file a second time, rather, it just provides a link to the previous version of that file that is identical. This saves space. Often times, the Git is on a local hard drive so it does not have to go anywhere to retrieve these snapshots.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many commands used to interact with Git. The git init command takes a directory and changes it into a Git repository. If you want to create a repository, this is the first thing you must do. If you want to add and commit files, you must first use the git init command. Git add is the second major command. This command adds files to a virtual waiting room before it is committed into the repository. The final big Git command is git commit. This saves the changes made to the file to a repository and gives it its own identification so it is able to be traced back for later reference.</p>
